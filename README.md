# thermalNet
# predicting thermal dynamics using a deep learning neural network framework.
# TODO for testing:
# 1. clone (download) the repository as thermalNet-main to your local environment, e.g. Desktop.
# 2. in the thermalNet-main, create a new python file. E.g. yournameTest.py in Sublime Text or Anaconda Jupyter.
# 3. in yournameTest.py, define a function called yournameTest() that prints out a sentence of self-introduction.
# 4. uncomment the # yournameTest() in the test() function in test.py to call the function that you just wrote. Don't forget to import the lib!
# 5. run the code in the command prompt by typing python test.py, make sure the code works before pushing and updating it to our repository.
# 6. push the modified codes to our repository using Github Desktop, with a brief description of what you did, which should be updated to the website in 1 or 2 minutes.
# 7. always pull the repository to get the up-to-date code (since others might have changed certain functions), before you actually programming anything!
