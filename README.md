# thermalNet
# predicting thermal dynamics using a deep learning neural network framework.
# TODO for testing:
# 0. (If you have downloaded python before, uninstall it by 1. opening your command prompt as admin, then 2. run this cd C:\Users\<you name>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps, then 3. del python.exe, then 4. del python3.exe). Download python 3.5.4 (any version lower than 3.7): https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.4/python-3.5.4-amd64.exe; MUST add Python to PATH in the installation process. Download github desktop, sublime text, anaconda jupyter...we will also be using Mathpix, latex overleaf and other python libs (e.g. tensorflow: pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-0.12.0rc0-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl
).
# 1. clone (download) the repository as thermalNet-main to your local environment, e.g. Desktop.
# 2. in the thermalNet-main that you just downloaded/cloned, create a new python file. E.g. yournameTest.py in Sublime Text or Anaconda Jupyter.
# 3. in yournameTest.py, define a function called yournameTest() that prints out a sentence of self-introduction.
# 4. uncomment the # yournameTest() in the test() function in test.py to call the function that you just wrote. Don't forget to import the lib!
# 5. run the code in the command prompt by typing python test.py in the thermalNet-main directory, make sure the code works before pushing and updating it to our repository.
# 6. push the modified codes to our repository using Github Desktop, with a brief description of what you did, which should be updated to the website in 1 or 2 minutes.
# 7. always fetch/pull the repository to get the up-to-date code (since others might have changed certain functions), before you actually programming anything!
